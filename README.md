# Stock-Market-Analysis-Challenge

## Background
    In this assignment I was tasked with writing a VBA script that analyzes stock market data.
   
    This script:
        * loops through each year of data and returns the total stock volume and respective ticker symbol for each stock
        * calculates yearly change of a stock from the opening price at the beginning of the year to it's closing price at the end of the year
        * conditionally formats yearly changes based on whether the changes were positive or negative
        * shows the greatest percent increase, decrease and greatest total stock volume for each year, along with their respective ticker symbols.
   
    I also wrote another script that clears all of the data created by the first script, so that I was able to easily test different parts of the script without having to spend needless time resetting all of my entries.
