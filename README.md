# Stock-Market-Analysis-Challenge

## Background
    In this project I had to write a VBA script that analyzes stock market data.
    This script:
        * loops through each year of data and returns the total stock volume and respective ticker symbol for each stock
        * calculates yearly change of a stock from the opening price at the beginning of the year to it's closing price at the end of the year
        * conditionally formats yearly changes based on whether the changes were positive or negative
        * shows the greatest percent increase, decrease and greatest total stock volume for each year, along with their respective ticker symbols.

## Results
